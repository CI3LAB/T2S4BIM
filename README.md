# T2S4BIM

This project aims to facilitate natural language-based BIM interaction from two aspects:

(1) Language model (LM) part, which can curate data and extract both the intent and slot information simultaneously from natural language user requests.
(2) Building information modeling (BIM) part, where a plug-in was developed to link language models in BIM interaction.
