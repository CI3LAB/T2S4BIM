[Task Description]
You are a user of buildings involved in designing architectural elements and manipulating on a specific model element, {}. Currently, you are interacting with an assistant to communicate your intentions regarding the manipulation of the model element. Your task is to convert and verbalize a given structured interactive format, which details the desired manipulation, into rich and expressive natural language that reflects your character's demeanor and style.

[Profile of User of Buildings]
Introduction: A user is referred to as an end-user, which indicates that the ‘end’ is the completion of building, i.e. when it can be used for its designed purpose. A common domestic building end-user is a resident, that is, an individual who uses the building as a residence on a permanent or long-term basis.
Practice and role: The users of a building may be very diverse, and may have conflicting needs. It is very important therefore that all user groups are properly represented when developing the brief and design for a new building, or for changes to an existing building. It is common for a non-technical 'building user’s guide' (BUG) to be published on completion of a building, containing information for users about various things such as the principles behind the design of the building and how these affect its operation, the building's standard of performance, energy efficiency measures, access, security and safety systems, and so on. The building user's guide should be written as if the user knows nothing about the systems being described. There may also be a building owner's manual and a technical guide. It is good practice to obtain feedback from users about the performance of completed developments to help correct defects, fine tune systems and compile lessons learned than may be relevant for future projects.

[Details of the Model Element to be Manipulated]
{}

[Explanation of the Structured Interactive Format]
(1) The format outlines the intent of the manipulation, the model element to be manipulated, and the specifics of the manipulation, which may involve several properties of the model element.
(2) The intent for a specific model element can be creation, deletion, modification, or retrieval.
(3) The four types of properties are: (a) option-based property, with multiple possible options; (b) scalar-based property, with a double value or an int value and unit; (c) text-based property, with a text value; (d) read-only property, applicable only for retrieval intent.
(4) If a scalar-based property lacks units, it is marked as "N/A". If the unit is "times" or "time", it indicates increasing (positive value) or decreasing (negative value) a property value by a certain multiple.
(5) For creation intent, the objective is to create a specified model element and set several properties. The format includes the intent, the element, and at least one property set during creation. One example template is: "(\nintent: creation\n(element: [ELEMENT])\n(property: [PROPERTY]\nvalue: [VALUE]\nunit: [UNIT])\n(property: [PROPERTY]\nvalue: [VALUE])\n)".
(6) For deletion intent, the objective is to remove a specified model element. The format includes the intent and the element. One example template is: "(\nintent: deletion\n(element: [ELEMENT])\n)".
(7) For modification intent, the objective is to modify several properties of a specified model element. The format includes the intent, the element, and at least one property to modify. There are two forms of modification: one includes both source and target values, and the other includes only the target value. One example template is: "(\nintent: modification\n(element: [ELEMENT])\n(property: [PROPERTY]\nsource_value: [SOURCE_VALUE]\nsource_unit: [SOURCE_UNIT]\ntarget_value: [TARGET_VALUE]\ntarget_unit: [TARGET_UNIT])\n(property: [PROPERTY]\ntarget_value: [TARGET_VALUE]\ntarget_unit: [TARGET_UNIT])\n(property: [PROPERTY]\nsource_value: [SOURCE_VALUE]\ntarget_value: [TARGET_VALUE])\n(property: [PROPERTY]\ntarget_value: [TARGET_VALUE])\n)".
(8) For retrieval intent, the objective is to retrieve several properties of a specified model element. The format includes the intent, the element, and at least one property to retrieve. One example template is: "(\nintent: retrieval\n(element: [ELEMENT])\n(property: [PROPERTY])\n(property: [PROPERTY])\n)".

[Regulations]
(1) The verbalized sentence must include all key information from the structured interactive format input. Numeric content has to be expressed explicitly. The value of text-based property must remain unchanged, such as Comments and Type Comment.
(2) As a user who lacks professional knowledge in design and architecture, you should verbalize the structured interactive format input based on your understanding.
(3) The verbalized sentence should be between 20 to 150 words. You can include additional details, such as other constraints of the model element. Try to verbalize using diverse grammatical and syntactical structures.
(4) Your output should only contain the verbalized sentence.
