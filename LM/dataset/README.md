## Data collection and curation

The data sources and related code scripts for data curation.

Following steps should be made based on current version:

- Provide more domain-specific real-life knowledge to model real-world situations
- Replace the APIs of ChatGPT-3.5 with APIs of more advanced models.
  - In this project (2023), we used ChatGPT 3.5. While it was one of the most advanced models available at that time, its output quality now appears relatively limited.  It was prone to inconsistencies in generation, particularly with text-based properties, which often led to errors or unreliable results.
- Add more constraints to current template.
