Introduction: A user is referred to as an end-user, which indicates that the ‘end’ is the completion of building, i.e. when it can be used for its designed purpose. A common domestic building end-user is a resident, that is, an individual who uses the building as a residence on a permanent or long-term basis.

Practice and role: The users of a building may be very diverse, and may have conflicting needs. It is very important therefore that all user groups are properly represented when developing the brief and design for a new building, or for changes to an existing building. It is common for a non-technical 'building user’s guide' (BUG) to be published on completion of a building, containing information for users about various things such as the principles behind the design of the building and how these affect its operation, the building's standard of performance, energy efficiency measures, access, security and safety systems, and so on. The building user's guide should be written as if the user knows nothing about the systems being described. There may also be a building owner's manual and a technical guide. It is good practice to obtain feedback from users about the performance of completed developments to help correct defects, fine tune systems and compile lessons learned than may be relevant for future projects.
